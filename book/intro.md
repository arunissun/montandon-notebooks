# Montandon Data Cookbook

:::{admonition} About This Cookbook
:class: important
A hands-on collection of **9 ready-to-run recipes** for querying, analysing, and
visualising disaster data through the IFRC Montandon STAC API — from your first
API call to animated cyclone-track maps and cascading-impact case studies.

## What Is Montandon?

**Montandon** is the IFRC's disaster-data platform. It provides a single,
standards-based [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)](https://stacspec.org)
endpoint that aggregates records from multiple authoritative sources
{cite}`stac_spec`.

The platform organises every record into three linked item types:

| Item Type | Description | Example Collections |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Event** | A discrete disaster occurrence | `gdacs-events`, `emdat-events`, `glide-events` |
| **Hazard** | Physical parameters of the event | `gdacs-hazards`, `usgs-hazards`, `ibtracs-hazards` |
| **Impact** | Human, economic, and infrastructure consequences | `emdat-impacts`, `idmc-gidd-impacts` |

Items sharing the same `monty:corr_id` (correlation&nbsp;ID) can be joined
across types, enabling event → hazard → impact analysis in a single workflow.
